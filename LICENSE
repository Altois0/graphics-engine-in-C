This license explains what you can and cant do with my code:
anyone can use my code for personal purposes, like using PicOs for YOUR OWN microcontroller, ANY other use, comercial or otherwise, including but not limited to: 

using my software for classes, either as a teaching point or, for example using PicOs to help students with learning microcontrollers.

selling any piece of software i write

will require my EXPLICIT PERMISSION. you can request said permision via my email: a.shegatech@gmail.com

If you choose to contribute to any of my projects you have the rights to the code you write and only the code you write. I suggest using you own license

 If this license is ignored, I will personally write a cease and desist, failure to comply further will result in a lawsuit.
